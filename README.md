# Web Project - 7Travel
During my studies, I've made a website with Laravel's Framework, Blade's templates and Bootstrap (because UI Design wasn't our priority) which deals about a car location's company.
## Tasks
This website must have an authentication page for users' company. When a customer needs a car, the user fills out a form with the specified car, the customer and the travel. When the contract is made, we can see it and even cancel it.
